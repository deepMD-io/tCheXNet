    What this script is doing is that
    1. It first loads a tCheXNet nodel
    2. It then made predictions on the Chexpert validation dataset (frontal only)
       The validation data contains 202 frontal chest x-ray images,
       from 200 unique patients.
       It is the testing dataset for this study
    3. The performance was then evaluated on one of the common classes, which is
       'Pneumothorax'. Area under ROC curve is computed.
